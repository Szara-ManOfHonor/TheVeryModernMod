 tvmm_usa.1.d:0 "The American people turned out in droves yesterday to vote for the next leader of our great country. Fed up with the sham of democracy and human decency, they voted overwhelmingly for the independent candidate, a frog."
 tvmm_usa.1.a:0 "How could this happen?!"
 tvmm_usa.2.t:0 "Frog elected President!!"
 tvmm_usa.2.d:0 "The results are in and undoubtable! The frog has won the election in a landslide not seen since the elections of George Washington himself! To arms! The American people will scour the world of the scourge of totalitarianism! And the Dutch, for reasons as yet unclear."
 tvmm_usa.2.a:0 "The world has gone mad!!"
